# Toy Compiler in java
We developed a toy compiler as a project in Compiler Design course of our 6th semester. It was done in a group of five members. Each phase of compilation has been done by each members. **Compiler1** is the complete code. **toy compiler.pdf** has document explanation associated with it. We left out the *Code Optimser phase* and *Target Code Generation phase* as that was not required by the instructor. Video explanation is also there with google drive link.

Following are the timecodes for the video: <br />
00.00 - 2.00 -- Introduction and Grammar <br />
2.01 - 4.28 -- Phase1 (Lexical Analysis) <br />
4.30 - 8.37 -- Phase2 (Syntax Analysis) <br />
8.38 - 11.58 -- Phase3 (Semantic Analysis) <br />
11.59 - 15.20 -- Phase4 (Code Generation) <br />
15.21 - END -- Execution of Code/ DEMO
